To extract modes required, please update paths and run mode-extraction-and-selection.ipynb

To simulate forces on these images after mode extraction, update paths, and run run_simulation(_resonance).py. Set direction, magnitude, location, and how many timesteps you'd like to run in the code. run_simulation.py on default runs the bridge example, and run_simulation_resonance.py runs simulation on the vibrating-resonance-towers example.
